      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        At Balto, I was part of the
        <a
          href="https://www.balto.ai/conversation-excellence-lab/"
          target="_blank"
          >Conversation Excellence Lab</a
        >, which conducts academic research to generate insights for contact
        centers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this project, we partnered with Centiment to survey over 2,000
        contact center agents in order to find out more about the typical agent
        profile and experience. We asked a number of basic demographic
        questions, as well as more in-depth questions related to their job
        satisfaction and enjoyment, their career aspirations, their motivations
        for joining the industry, and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the reasons for conducting this survey was that at the time of
        this research, America was in the midst of the “Great Resignation”, when
        many employees were quitting in droves. Many of our customers in the
        contact center industry were hit hard by these resignations, so we
        performed this analysis to help them reduce attrition by giving them
        insight into their workers’ motivations.
      </p>
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dM3koLb-ENfYdE-6cFJir-U_gp8zZ2swhueMq20qkFY/edit#gid=1636211487"
          target="_blank"
          >Here</a
        >
        is a link to a subset of the raw data, as well as all of the analyses
        performed in individual sheets. I used Google Sheets for this project.
        Each sheet measures the effect of a different independent variable (such
        as gender, education level, or salary) on a wide variety of dependent
        variables (such as satisfaction with pay or where they see themselves in
        5 years).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some variables were used as both an independent variable and a dependent
        variable. For example, we asked about the agent’s fear about
        automation/AI replacing them in the workforce- this fear of automation
        was examined as both a predictor of job enjoyment (in which case fear of
        automation was the independent variable) and as a result of demographic
        factors (in which case it was the dependent variable). Many other
        variables were treated similarly.
      </p>
      <h2>Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
        The deliverable of this analysis was a series of articles, published on
        our website, which summarized our findings and gave suggestions to
        contact center managers about how to apply them. I did not write these
        articles, but I did perform all the analyses and create all of the
        graphs found in the articles using a JavaScript library called Chart.js.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Every year, hundreds of the most talented young opera singers in the
        country audition for the chance to take part in one of a handful of
        prestigious summer opera festivals. These singers prepare 4-6 pieces
        (known as "arias") to sing for a panel of judges, and usually perform
        1-3 of them. One festival, Wolf Trap Opera in Vienna, Virginia, compiles
        a yearly list of every single aria that was offered by a singer. By
        looking at a collection of these lists over the years, one can gain a
        pretty clear picture of which arias, operas, and composers are most
        popular among young vocal artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing these arias was fundamental to my career as an opera pianist.
        One of my most reliable sources of income was playing for singers in
        these auditions, and often playing an entire day of auditions for the
        opera companies. I would sit in a room for 8 hours as singers came in
        one after the other, and I would have to perform whatever they put in
        front of me, whether I knew it or not. Needless to say, this job became
        a lot easier the more arias I had in my back pocket. It's not possible
        to learn every aria, but by learning the most popular, I could get a
        pretty good handle on what I might have to play.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundational importance of knowing these popular arias was what
        motivated me to assemble Wolf Trap's list into a database back in 2019.
        I spent hours manually typing out all the data about the pieces and
        calculating the totals across a 7-year period from 2013-2019. I
        basically found out what I needed to know, but I was curious to come
        back to this dataset after learning some real data analysis and
        visualization tools like Google Sheets/Excel, SQL, and Tableau.

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        I performed three types of queries in my analysis: some to filter the
        aria list, some to determine the popularity of different
        composers/operas/etc, and some to track changes across time.
      </p>
      <h4>Filtering the Aria List</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to playing arias in auditions, one of my other main roles
        was to coach singers and help them choose repertoire. A singer might
        come to me and ask for a new piece to work on- they might have a
        language in mind, or an era of music, or they might want to choose
        something less popular to stand out. SQL provides the tools to filter
        the data in any of these ways, to meet any request of any singer. I
        included several different sample queries in my analysis that filtered
        the data based on potential requests, including:

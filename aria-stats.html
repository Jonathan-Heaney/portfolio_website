      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Every year, hundreds of the most talented young opera singers in the
        country audition for the chance to take part in one of a handful of
        prestigious summer opera festivals. These singers prepare 4-6 pieces
        (known as "arias") to sing for a panel of judges, and usually perform
        1-3 of them. One festival, Wolf Trap Opera in Vienna, Virginia, compiles
        a yearly list of every single aria that was offered by a singer. By
        looking at a collection of these lists over the years, one can gain a
        pretty clear picture of which arias, operas, and composers are most
        popular among young vocal artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing these arias was fundamental to my career as an opera pianist.
        One of my most reliable sources of income was playing for singers in
        these auditions, and often playing an entire day of auditions for the
        opera companies. I would sit in a room for 8 hours as singers came in
        one after the other, and I would have to perform whatever they put in
        front of me, whether I knew it or not. Needless to say, this job became
        a lot easier the more arias I had in my back pocket. It's not possible
        to learn every aria, but by learning the most popular, I could get a
        pretty good handle on what I might have to play.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundational importance of knowing these popular arias was what
        motivated me to assemble Wolf Trap's list into a database back in 2019.
        I spent hours manually typing out all the data about the pieces and
        calculating the totals across a 7-year period from 2013-2019. I
        basically found out what I needed to know, but I was curious to come
        back to this dataset after learning some real data analysis and
        visualization tools like Google Sheets/Excel, SQL, and Tableau.

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        I performed three types of queries in my analysis: some to filter the
        aria list, some to determine the popularity of different
        composers/operas/etc, and some to track changes across time.
      </p>
      <h4>Filtering the Aria List</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to playing arias in auditions, one of my other main roles
        was to coach singers and help them choose repertoire. A singer might
        come to me and ask for a new piece to work on- they might have a
        language in mind, or an era of music, or they might want to choose
        something less popular to stand out. SQL provides the tools to filter
        the data in any of these ways, to meet any request of any singer. I
        included several different sample queries in my analysis that filtered
        the data based on potential requests, including:

            >(Graph)</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Popularity Across Categories</h4>
      <p>
        Knowing the most popular arias is extremely helpful, but to gain a
        broader picture, I also wanted to know the most common composers,
        operas, languages, and voice parts.
      </p>
      <p>Some key takeaways from these analyses:</p>
      <h5>
        - Mozart is far and away the most important composer of arias for young
        singers.
      </h5>
      <p>
        It's actually standard practice for every singer to include a Mozart
        aria in their package of 4-6 pieces; he is the only composer to inspire
        such a requirement.
      </p>
      <p>Statistics to illustrate Mozart's dominance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mozart's arias were offered 3,184 times; the second highest was Verdi
          with only 940.
          <a
            href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.heaney/viz/AriaStats/ComposerFrequencyAriaCount"
            target="_blank"
            >(Graph)</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Each of the top 4 most-represented operas are by Mozart.
          <a
            href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.heaney/viz/AriaStats/OperaFrequencyCount"
            target="_blank"
            >(Graph)</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Mozart is the most popular composer in both Italian AND German.
          <a
            href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.heaney/viz/AriaStats/ComposersbyLanguage"
            target="_blank"
            >(Graph)</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>- Italian is the most prominent language, followed by English.</h5>
      <p>
        Singers are traditionally asked to offer arias across 4 standard
        languages- Italian, French, German, and English. Some leave out one of
        these and replace it with a wild card like Russian or Czech, or some
        lean more heavily on one language in particular. In the end, Italian is
        far and away the most popular language; opera is an Italian art form,
        after all.

      <p>
        English coming in second is a bit surprising in the context of operatic
        repertoire as a whole. France and Germany both have more distinguished
        operatic traditions than the United Kingdom and United States. However,
        for opera auditions in America, it isn't as surprising. Singers are
        nearly always requested to provide a contemporary piece in English, both
        to assess musicianship (contemporary scores are usually more complex)
        and English proficiency (talking to donors/patrons is part of the job
        description for singers).
      </p>
      <h5>- Voice types are not equally represented in the pool of singers.</h5>
      <p>
        Competition for roles is a lot stiffer for young women than young men in
        opera. Many more female singers (sopranos or mezzo-sopranos) audition
        than male singers (tenor, baritone, bass, or countertenor).

      <h4>Changes Across Time</h4>
      <p>
        As part of my data cleaning process, I looked up the premiere year of
        every opera in the list. In so doing, I was able to see which decades
        and centuries produced the most popular composers, arias, and operas. I
        was also able to track the popularity of different languages across
        time, to see if a certain country was dominant in a particular era.
      </p>
      <p>Some takeaways:</p>
      <h5>- The 19th century was the most productive period for opera.</h5>
      <p>
        The 1800s are on top in the number of operas produced, number of arias
        produced, and frequency of those arias being offered. Many of the
        composers most closely associated with opera (Verdi, Rossini, Wagner,
        etc) did most or all of their work in this century. Mozart wrote
        everything at the end of the 18th century, and he alone accounts for
        much of the output from that period.

      <h5>- Different languages have been dominant in different periods.</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Italy was a consistent source of opera from the beginning (around
          1600) until the 1920s or so, when Puccini died.
        </li>
        <li>
          English opera had one hit composer in the late 1600s, Henry Purcell,
          and then was essentially irrelevant until the 1930s. From the 1930s
          on, opera in English has been on top, mostly due to the quirks of the
          American opera audition process as discussed above.
        </li>
        <li>
          French opera had a few popular works in the mix in the 18th century,
          but the French tradition really exploded from the 1860s to the 1880s,
          when it overtook Italian as the most popular language for all three
          decades.
        </li>
        <li>
          German has been part of the equation since Mozart in the 1780s, but
          only rarely as the most popular language. However, German opera is
          more important than these statistics would indicate: many of the key
          German composers (Wagner, Richard Strauss, etc) wrote massive pieces
          for huge orchestra that are, with some exceptions, too mature for most
          young singers to tackle.
        </li>

        - Generally speaking, the number of composers and operas represented has
        increased over time.

      <p>
        While the 19th century produced the most operas and arias, the 20th
        century saw by far the most composers represented. The 21st century,
        less than 1/5 complete at the time of this data collection, is on pace
        to smash that record.

        There's no way of proving exactly why this might be the case, but my
        hypothesis is that the main reason is due to filtering effects over
        time. There were LOTS of composers writing new operas in the 17th, 18th,
        and 19th centuries; however, only the very best pieces have stood the
        test of centuries, so we're left with only a smaller number of composers
        and operas, many of which are quite popular and frequently-performed.
        The 21st century hasn't seen many of these filter effects yet: there are
        a lot of different composers/operas, but none have gained so much
        traction as to be extremely popular. So right now, the data show a lower
        number of total aria performances from the 21st century (because none of
        the individual pieces are that popular yet), but a huge diversity of
        composers and operas, more than in any other decade.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the
        <a
          href="https://www.balto.ai/conversation-excellence-lab/"
          target="_blank"
          >Conversation Excellence Lab</a

        at Balto, I performed analyses on questions that were important to our
        customers in the contact center space. One of the questions that kept
        coming up was whether executives should consider their contact center as
        a cost center or a profit center. Would investing resources into a
        contact center pay off, or would it be better to simply cut costs as
        much as possible?
      </p>
      <p>
        To study this question, we launched a survey of over 360 executives
        (director-level or above) who work with or alongside contact centers in
        their organization. These executives answered a number of basic
        demographic questions, both about themselves and their organization.
        They also answered three key questions that served as a proxy for how
        likely they were to view their contact center as a cost center or profit
        center. We asked them to rate their agreement with the following
        statements, on a scale of 1-5:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Great service is the best way to build customer loyalty.</li>
        <li>
          Excellent service is less important than solving a customer’s problem
          as quickly as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Anything other than self-service support for customers ends up being a
          drain on company resources.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We also asked them for a few metrics that would assess their
        organization’s results: agent attrition rate, customer NPS (Net Promoter
        Score) and CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) score. Our hypothesis was that
        the executives that viewed their contact centers as profit centers,
        rather than as cost centers, would have better performance on these
        metrics.
      </p>
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>I performed my analysis in both Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel.</p>
      <p>
        In
        <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d_9B6IgP3sd_a8kw2hHMiN-6w9Pk_mZa6zLkYhc8YvQ/edit#gid=787026647"
          target="_blank"
          >this Google Sheets document</a
        >, which includes a subset of the raw survey data, I analyzed the
        effects of many different variables. Each sheet measures the effect of a
        different independent variable (such as age, industry, or title) on a
        variety of dependent variables (such as agreement with the cost center
        statements).
      </p>
      <p>
        With Excel, I installed the Real Statistics for Excel package to perform
        more complicated statistical tests that couldn’t be done in Google
        Sheets, particularly the ANOVA/Tukey HSD (honestly significant
        difference) tests. These tests are used to determine whether any means
        are significantly different from each other, and if so, which ones. For
        example, I would test whether the mean NPS of executives who answered
        with a low score to one of the cost center questions was significantly
        different from the mean NPS among those who answered with a high score.
        I performed many of these tests- the process and results can be found in
        <a

          target="_blank"
          >this Excel workbook</a
        >. There are comments throughout the document which highlight specific
        results.
      </p>
      <h2>Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this analysis was to publish articles on our website
        highlighting our findings and providing suggestions to contact center
        managers about how to apply them. I did not write these articles, but I
        did perform all the analyses and create all of the graphs found in the
        articles using a JavaScript library called Chart.js.

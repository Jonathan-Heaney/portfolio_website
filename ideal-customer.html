      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, I was asked to help identify our company’s ideal
        customer profile. Our company, Balto, sold an AI tool for contact
        centers that gave agents real-time suggestions of what to say on every
        call.
      </p>
      <p>There were three specific areas that I was asked to focus on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Industry- We had customers across a variety of industries, and our
          executives wanted to know if we should target or avoid any of those
          industries in particular moving forward.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tier- Our Revenue Operations Manager had developed a tentative tier
          system based on what he thought would be the traits of a good
          customer. There were 3 tiers, and my task was to validate whether
          these tiers did indeed line up with positive results.
        </li>
        <li>
          Integration type- Our product had to integrate with the customer’s
          softphone system. It was easier for us to integrate with some systems
          than with others, so we had developed a softphone scoring system. I
          was asked to verify that this scoring system was correlated with
          positive outcomes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        I collected data from a variety of sources. The main one was Salesforce,
        but a lot of data came from Google Sheets, Pendo, or even individual
        contracts.
      </p>
      <p>I compiled data on all of our current as well as churned customers.</p>
      <p>
        Some of the most important data points to consider were the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)</li>
        <li>
          Churn rate- What percent of customers within a given industry stopped
          using our product
        </li>
        <li>
          Sales cycle length- The number of days between when we first made
          contact with a potential customer and when we signed a deal
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CPqkQYtSs_EDbA1xS0bW-tmlgDwail9n6jPC51-TVI0/edit#gid=4274183"
          target="_blank"
          >Here</a
        >
        is a link to the dataset, as well as all the analyses. I performed all
        the analysis in Google Sheets, with different sheets for the industry,
        tier, and integration analysis for both current and churned customers,
        as well as some sheets for direct comparison between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
        A note about the dataset- to maintain privacy, all company names and
        softphone brands have been changed, and many other aspects of the
        dataset have been changed as well.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wniSkVkQi_gggz6TIucv6ItBz-6iE4yK8Ye8nP_e-0U/edit#slide=id.g35f391192_00"
          target="_blank"
          >Here</a
        >
        is a slide deck with a summary of key takeaways, which I presented to
        executive stakeholders upon finishing the analysis.
